# Project 3 - Simple Twitter Client

**Macaw** is an android app that allows a user to view his Twitter timeline and post a new tweet. The app utilizes [Twitter REST API](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public).

Time spent: **25** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [X]	User can **sign in to Twitter** using OAuth login
* [X]	User can **view tweets from their home timeline**
  * [X] User is displayed the username, name, and body for each tweet
  * [X] User is displayed the [relative timestamp](https://gist.github.com/nesquena/f786232f5ef72f6e10a7) for each tweet "8m", "7h"
  * [X] User can view more tweets as they scroll with [infinite pagination](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Endless-Scrolling-with-AdapterViews-and-RecyclerView). Number of tweets is unlimited.
    However there are [Twitter Api Rate Limits](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/rate-limiting) in place.
* [X] User can **compose and post a new tweet**
  * [X] User can click a “Compose” icon in the Action Bar on the top right
  * [X] User can then enter a new tweet and post this to twitter
  * [X] User is taken back to home timeline with **new tweet visible** in timeline

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [X] User can **see a counter with total number of characters left for tweet** on compose tweet page
* [X] User can **click a link within a tweet body** on tweet details view. The click will launch the web browser with relevant page opened.
* [X] User can **pull down to refresh tweets timeline**
* [X] User can **open the twitter app offline and see last loaded tweets**. Persisted in SQLite tweets are refreshed on every application launch. While "live data" is displayed when app can get it from Twitter API, it is also saved for use in offline mode.
* [X] User can tap a tweet to **open a detailed tweet view**
* [X] User can **select "reply" from detail view to respond to a tweet**
* [X] Improve the user interface and theme the app to feel "twitter branded"

The following **bonus** features are implemented:

* [X] User can see embedded image media within the tweet detail view
* [X] User can watch embedded video within the tweet
* [X] Compose tweet functionality is build using modal overlay
* [X] Use Parcelable instead of Serializable using the popular [Parceler library](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-Parceler).
* [X] Apply the popular [Butterknife annotation library](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Reducing-View-Boilerplate-with-Butterknife) to reduce view boilerplate.
* [X] Leverage the popular [GSON library](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-Android-Async-Http-Client#decoding-with-gson-library) to streamline the parsing of JSON data.
* [X] [Leverage RecyclerView](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-the-RecyclerView) as a replacement for the ListView and ArrayAdapter for all lists of tweets.
* [X] Move the "Compose" action to a [FloatingActionButton](https://github.com/codepath/android_guides/wiki/Floating-Action-Buttons) instead of on the AppBar.
* [X] Replace Picasso with [Glide](http://inthecheesefactory.com/blog/get-to-know-glide-recommended-by-google/en) for more efficient image rendering.
